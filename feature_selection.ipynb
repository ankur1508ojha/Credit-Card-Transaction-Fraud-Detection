    "Feature selection is a process of selecting a subset of relevant features or variables from a larger set of features that are available in a dataset. It is done to improve the performance of a machine-learning model by reducing the complexity of the data and preventing overfitting. The main objective of feature selection is to remove irrelevant, redundant, or noisy features that do not contribute significantly to the predictive accuracy of the model while retaining the most important features that capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n"
